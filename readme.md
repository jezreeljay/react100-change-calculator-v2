# React Change Calculator

This project demos a simple react calculator styled with bootstrap. This is a clone of [V1](https://github.com/jezreeljay/react100-change-calculator), originally to debug Next deployement errors of my previous build. This app:

* Validates input and throws appropriate alerts and prompts.
* Calculates total change and displays appropriate denominations in USD.

Working example deployed via [NOW](#).
