# React Change Calculator

This project demos a simple react calculator styled with bootstrap. This is a clone of [V1](https://github.com/jezreeljay/react100-change-calculator) to debug why the working dev build fails to deploy via NOW. This clone:

1. Migrates working JSX into app.jsx and index.jsx
2. Tries to clean up package and package-lock
3. Adds test rules for CSS in **webpack.config**

My assumption is that there's some kind of discrepency in my webpack configuration. But it remains a mystery :(

Working example deployed via [NOW](#) is pending.
